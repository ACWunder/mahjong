# Mahjong Calculator 🀄️

Welcome to the **Mahjong Calculator** – a small yet handy tool I created for my Mahjong-loving aunts! 🎉

## 🌟 About the Project

My aunts are passionate Mahjong players, but keeping track of points can sometimes get tricky (especially after long games!). To make their game nights more enjoyable, I built this simple, browser-based calculator to handle the math for them.
